**The assignment im currently stuck on is:**

"Write a program that scrolls a string along the LED matrix of the micro:bit, in a for loop. Each time through the loop, the loop variable i should be concatenated to the string before its shown. Note that + will not work on a string and a number, like "hello" + 6, so i needs to be converted to a string "i" by calling its toString() method. Remember how we added to a variable, like i = i + 3; you have to do something similar with your string variable."
